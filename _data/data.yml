    The publication section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any publications that you have authored or contributed to. This section is particularly relevant for individuals in academic or research fields, but can also be relevant for individuals in other fields who have published articles or papers.

    Publications can include academic journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, reports, or other written works. In this section, you should list the title of the publication, the names of any co-authors, the name of the publication or conference, the date of publication, and any other relevant details.

    If you have a long list of publications, you may want to consider including only the most relevant or significant publications on your resume. Alternatively, you could create a separate publication list and provide it as a separate document, either in your application materials or upon request.

    Including a publication section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and credibility in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any publications to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    When including your awards on your resume, be sure to focus on the most significant or relevant awards that showcase your skills and expertise. If you have received a long list of awards, you may want to consider including only the most recent or prestigious awards on your resume.

    By highlighting your awards, you can demonstrate your achievements and accomplishments in your field, and can help differentiate yourself from other candidates. However, if you have not received any awards, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    The patent section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any patents that you have been granted or are in the process of obtaining. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who work in scientific or technical fields, as well as for individuals who have developed innovative products or technologies.

    In this section, you should list the title of the patent, the name of the inventors, the patent number, and the date it was granted. If the patent is pending, you can indicate that it is "pending" or "in review." You may also want to provide a brief description of the technology or invention that the patent covers.

    Including a patent section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any patents to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    Template for a pending patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date]. Patent pending.

This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

    In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments.

    This section can be especially valuable for candidates seeking positions in the non-profit sector, social work, or community engagement roles, where experience in social or cultural organizations can demonstrate a genuine passion for social causes and a willingness to work collaboratively towards social change. However, it is important to only include organizations that are relevant to the job you are applying for, and avoid listing organizations that may be controversial or potentially offensive.

  title: Self-evaluation
  description: |
    The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

reference:
  show: false
  order: 14
  title: References
  description: |
    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
